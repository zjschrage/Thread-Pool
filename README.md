# Thread-Pool
A Thread Pool in C++

Thread Pool Defined in threadpool.h and implementation in threadpool.cpp
An example Runner classes uses the ThreadPool object and passes a random worker function
from some "user code" demonstrating its usage. The example worker functions are all implemented 
in user_code.h for simplicity.
